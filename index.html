        <p>We have exciting news for Slack users. If you're using or considering managing Jira tickets directly within Slack, you'll appreciate our new integration with HelpDesk+ and Canned Responses Pro. </p>
        <p>Many teams already use the HelpDesk+ app to transition, assign, and comment on tickets stored in Jira Service Management directly from Slack, which reduces the need for context switching. We have now added Canned Responses Pro to this toolkit. If your service team actively uses Slack for communication and you don't want to switch between Slack and Jira while managing tickets, you can now work even faster using your favorite response templates right within Slack.</p>

You can now set up and automatically update the Resolution field and any single or multi-select custom fields in Jira while adding a comment or making transitions.</p>
        <h4>New and improved Smart Suggestions</h4>
        <p>We’ve made some changes to Smart Suggestions and also launched this feature on the browser extension version of Canned Responses. Based on your feedback, we’ve made this feature more intuitive and helpful with greater flexibility around inserting sentences and parts of templates.</p>
        <h4>Tag everybody everywhere</h4>
        <p>You can now mention users when you add comments without the browser extension or tag people directly in your templates. Small feature, huge value. Enjoy it.</p>

      <h2>Appfire Position Statement on the Ukraine War and Russia</h2>

      <div class="column">

        <p>It is Appfire's position that we proudly stand with our Ukrainian teammates, their families, and all of Ukraine against Vladimir Putin and the Russian military and government. We condemn the military and political actions of Russia against Ukraine, and we will not support a Russian military or political presence in Ukraine.</p> 
        <p>Appfire has served the greater Atlassian community for sixteen years and, like many of you, we have customers and employees all over the world. Right now, we have team members leaving their homes in Ukraine, some of whom are staying with Appfire colleagues who have opened their hearts and homes in Bulgaria and Poland due to the unjust and illegal acts of war taking place in Ukraine.</p>
        <p>To that end, consistent with our values and with US sanctions, we will no longer sell our technology or provide support services to Russia, Belarus, or any other entity that supports the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
        <p>The ordinary citizens of Russia are not to blame for this war, and we will continue to support our Appfire employees and family members in Russia.</p>
        <p>Appfire is actively focused on helping our people in the region. We are providing alternate communication channels, offering financial assistance to team members and their families, adjusting compensation to account for local cost of living for relocated team members, providing dedicated channels for resource sharing and support, and making sure everyone can take as much paid time off as they need during this time. We are also working with our partners at Pledge 1% and have team members mobilizing independently to raise funds for Ukraine.</p>
        <p>We are not alone in our grief, expression of outrage, and desire to take a stand. We encourage Atlassian and all our friends in the ecosystem and technology community to join us by taking similar actions in support of the Ukrainian people.</p>
        <p>I stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and hope for peace and justice in Ukraine as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>– Randall Ward, CEO and Co-Founder, Appfire</p>

        <p>The Description tab will open by default whenever you select and insert the description template.</br>The Description's current contents (if any) will be automatically fetched to the editor, so you can instantly insert any templates into it.</p>

        <p>Just create a template as usual by clicking the "+" button but select "Issue description" in the "<strong>Target fields</strong>" section.</p>
        <p>"Target fields" let you decide where the template should be suggested. For example, it will not appear in the "Insert template..." dropdown for new comments when you leave "Comments" unselected. This is to show templates only where they belong and <strong>prevent mess</strong>.</p>

        <h4>Let us know what you think</h4>
        <p>Are there any <strong>other Jira fields</strong> that you would like to have templates for?</p>

        <p>For real ninja mode, try using <strong>templates as building blocks</strong> for your comments – create different openings, greetings, instructions sets, endings, etc. When you make them your favorites by starring them – they will be available for your comments with literally <strong>one click</strong> from the toolbar.</p>
